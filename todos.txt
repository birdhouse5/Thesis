I ran optuna phase 1-3 for hyperparameter sweeps
I analyzed results in 3 distinct scripts. Here I can consolidate into one analysis script.
I ran backtests, this one I need to alter into a stochsticity-controlling version.
I analyzed benchmarks and produces plots. This needs to be streamlined.

What about main.py, deeper_analysis.py, generate_configs.py, validate_best_model.py and validate_phase2_results.py?

I am using experiments/ and results/ -> this should be unified
