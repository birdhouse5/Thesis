⚖️ Justification

Max Episodes = 6000
A middle ground between the short 4000 and long 8000 runs. Gives the model ample training while avoiding excessive compute.

Validation Interval = 200
Frequent enough to catch plateaus early, but not as sparse as 500 (which might miss fine-grained learning dynamics). This was the most “aggressive” but also safe option you tested.

Min Episodes Before Stopping = 1500
Prevents overly early termination while keeping training efficient. 2000 (as in config_26) might waste compute if convergence is earlier, while 1000 (config_69) risks cutting off too soon.

Early Stopping Patience = 10 (new choice)
A compromise between 8 (cuts too quickly) and 12 (lets it drag on). This balances stability and efficiency.

Early Stopping Min Delta = 0.02 (new choice)
Middle ground between strict 0.01 (very sensitive, risk of premature stop) and lenient 0.05 (may waste time on marginal improvements). At 0.02, you still stop if validation stalls, but only after genuinely small improvements.
